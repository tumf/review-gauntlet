## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Review execution SHALL support JSON and JSONC command adapter configuration

Command adapter configuration validation SHALL reject invalid environment variable names and SHALL define how literal braces are represented in template-bearing strings. Configuration errors SHALL be reported before adapter execution. Adapter `cwd` settings SHALL resolve under the reviewed repository root and cwd values that resolve outside the repository SHALL be rejected before executing any adapter command.

Review execution SHALL resolve configuration using deterministic precedence: built-in defaults, then global config, then project config, then explicit CLI config/options. Global config SHALL be discovered from `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/review-gauntlet/config.jsonc` or fallback `~/.config/review-gauntlet/config.jsonc`. Project config SHALL prefer `.review-gauntlet/config.jsonc` and support `review-gauntlet.jsonc` for compatibility. Existing JSON config discovery MAY remain supported for backward compatibility. When multiple configuration layers are combined, objects SHALL deep merge, scalars SHALL use the last writer, and arrays SHALL replace earlier arrays. When no usable config is available, the failure guidance SHALL point to `review-gauntlet config preset list` for available bundled presets.

Explicit `--config` SHALL accept both absolute paths and repository-relative paths. Relative explicit config paths SHALL resolve under the reviewed repository root. Absolute explicit config paths MAY point outside the repository, but the resolved path SHALL exist and be a regular file. Explicit config SHALL take precedence over global and project discovery.

Command adapter output path templates SHALL be deterministic before prompt construction. `adapter.output.path` SHALL reject `{prompt}` because the prompt itself can contain the output path and would make prompt-time and read-time path resolution diverge. The `{prompt}` template variable SHALL remain supported for adapter `args` and `env`.

<!-- Expected canonical result after archive: missing-config guidance points to `review-gauntlet config preset list` instead of `review-gauntlet config list`. -->

#### Scenario: Missing config guidance is actionable

**Given**: no fixture, explicit config, project config, or global config is available
**When**: the developer runs `review-gauntlet review`
**Then**: the command fails with a usage error explaining that no Review Gauntlet config was found
**And**: the message shows how to create a project config with `review-gauntlet config init --preset opencode`
**And**: the message shows how to create a global config with `review-gauntlet config init --global --preset opencode`
**And**: the message points to `review-gauntlet config preset list` for available presets
