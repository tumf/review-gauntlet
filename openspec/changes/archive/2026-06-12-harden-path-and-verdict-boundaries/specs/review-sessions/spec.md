## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Review sessions SHALL persist durable state

`review-gauntlet` SHALL construct review universes from repository-confined files only. Target-scoped path inputs, review universe traversal, target digests, and file digests SHALL reject or omit absolute paths, parent-directory traversal, and symlink escapes that resolve outside the reviewed repository root. Invalid path inputs SHALL fail explicitly rather than being silently interpreted as repository files.

#### Scenario: Target-scoped inventory rejects escaping paths

**Given**: a repository root and a target path list containing `/tmp/escape.py` or `../escape.py`
**When**: the CLI builds target-scoped inventory for a review session
**Then**: the escaping paths are not classified as repository files
**And**: the command fails with an actionable path validation error when the path came from direct user input

#### Scenario: Review universe skips symlink escapes

**Given**: a repository containing a symlink that points to a file outside the repository root
**When**: `review-gauntlet` computes target digest and file digests
**Then**: the external symlink target is not read or hashed
**And**: in-repository regular files remain eligible for review universe hashing

### Requirement: Status and findings commands SHALL expose actionable session state

`findings --path` filters SHALL accept only repository-relative paths and directory prefixes. Absolute paths and parent-directory traversal SHALL fail with a usage error so filtering semantics remain repository-scoped and deterministic.

#### Scenario: Findings path filter rejects traversal

**Given**: an active session
**When**: the developer runs `review-gauntlet findings --path ../src`
**Then**: the command fails with a usage error
**And**: no finding state is modified

### Requirement: Review execution SHALL support JSON and JSONC command adapter configuration

Explicit command adapter configuration paths and adapter `cwd` settings SHALL resolve under the reviewed repository root. Configuration paths or cwd values that resolve outside the repository SHALL be rejected before executing any adapter command.

#### Scenario: Explicit config path outside repository is rejected

**Given**: an active review session
**When**: the developer runs `review-gauntlet review --config /tmp/review-gauntlet.jsonc`
**Then**: the command fails with an actionable configuration error
**And**: no external adapter command is executed

#### Scenario: Adapter cwd outside repository is rejected

**Given**: an active review session with a command adapter config whose `cwd` resolves outside the repository
**When**: `review-gauntlet review` evaluates a cell
**Then**: the selected cell fails with a structured adapter failure
**And**: no command is executed from the out-of-repository working directory

### Requirement: Command adapter SHALL invoke external tools safely and preserve artifacts

Command adapter artifact paths SHALL remain confined to the deterministic per-run cell artifact tree. Review cell IDs loaded from persisted state SHALL NOT be trusted as filesystem paths; malformed IDs containing path separators or parent traversal SHALL fail before artifact directories are created outside the cell artifact root.

#### Scenario: Unsafe cell id cannot escape artifact directory

**Given**: a command adapter receives a review cell whose ID contains `../`
**When**: the adapter prepares per-cell artifacts
**Then**: the adapter fails with a structured safety error
**And**: no artifact is written outside `.review-gauntlet/runs/<run_id>/cells/`

### Requirement: Command verdicts SHALL normalize through OCR comments only

External command adapter verdict comments SHALL be validated against the selected review cell before they affect findings or coverage. Each precise comment SHALL target the selected cell path and use a line range within the reviewed file. OCR-style imprecise comments with `start_line=0` and `end_line=0` SHALL remain valid.

#### Scenario: Cross-cell verdict comment is rejected

**Given**: a selected review cell for `src/app.py`
**And**: the external command emits a valid JSON verdict whose comment path is `src/other.py`
**When**: `review-gauntlet review` processes the verdict
**Then**: no finding occurrence is created from that comment
**And**: the selected cell is not marked reviewed
**And**: the review command exits non-zero with failure artifacts preserved

#### Scenario: Out-of-range verdict comment is rejected

**Given**: a selected review cell with ten lines
**And**: the external command emits a precise comment ending at line 999
**When**: `review-gauntlet review` processes the verdict
**Then**: the verdict is rejected as outside the review cell
**And**: coverage is not recorded for that cell

#### Scenario: Imprecise OCR verdict comment remains valid

**Given**: a selected review cell
**And**: the external command emits a comment for that cell with `start_line=0` and `end_line=0`
**When**: `review-gauntlet review` processes the verdict
**Then**: the comment is recorded as an imprecise finding occurrence
**And**: successful coverage can be recorded for the selected cell
