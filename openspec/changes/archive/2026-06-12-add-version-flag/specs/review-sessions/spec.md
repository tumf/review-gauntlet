## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: CLI SHALL expose package version without repository state

`review-gauntlet` SHALL provide a top-level `--version` flag that reports the package version from the existing package version source and exits successfully without requiring repository-root validation, active review-session state, adapter configuration, or review work.

#### Scenario: Version flag prints package version

**Given**: an installed or development invocation of the `review-gauntlet` CLI
**When**: the developer runs `review-gauntlet --version`
**Then**: stdout contains exactly `review-gauntlet <version>` followed by a newline, where `<version>` is the value exported from `review_gauntlet.__about__.__version__`
**And**: the command exits with code `0`

#### Scenario: Version flag bypasses repository validation

**Given**: the current working directory does not need to be a review target or active session root
**When**: the developer runs `review-gauntlet --version`
**Then**: the CLI prints the package version before attempting root path validation or session-store access
**And**: no review-gauntlet state directory or adapter configuration is required

#### Scenario: Existing subcommands keep their parser behavior

**Given**: the existing `review-gauntlet` subcommands and flags
**When**: developers run supported subcommands such as `inventory`, `plan`, `report`, `init`, `review`, `verify-fixes`, `status`, `findings`, `mark`, or `finalize`
**Then**: their accepted arguments, usage errors, output formats, and session behavior remain unchanged by the version flag
