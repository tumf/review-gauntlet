## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Existing planning commands SHALL remain compatible

Documentation for planning diagnostics SHALL use the current `--format json` output flag and SHALL NOT instruct users to run removed `--json` flags. Markdown report rendering SHALL preserve table structure by escaping or normalizing dynamic table-cell values such as IDs, statuses, checks, and evidence.

#### Scenario: Documentation uses current planning flags

**Given**: a reader follows repository smoke-command guidance
**When**: they run the documented inventory or plan JSON command
**Then**: the command uses `--format json`
**And**: the command is accepted by the current parser

#### Scenario: Report escapes table separators

**Given**: a review matrix row whose evidence contains a pipe character or newline
**When**: `review-gauntlet report` renders markdown output
**Then**: the coverage matrix remains a valid four-column markdown table
**And**: evidence content is preserved in escaped or normalized form

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Bootstrap instructions SHALL avoid mutable remote code execution

Repository bootstrap scripts SHALL NOT execute mutable remote installer content directly without pinning or integrity verification. If an automatic installer is used, the downloaded artifact SHALL be pinned and verified before execution; otherwise the script SHALL fail closed with an actionable instruction.

#### Scenario: Worktree setup does not pipe latest installer to shell

**Given**: a developer runs `.wt/setup` in a new worktree without the required hook tool installed
**When**: the setup script reaches hook installation
**Then**: it does not execute `curl ... | sh` from a mutable latest URL
**And**: it either verifies a pinned installer before execution or fails with instructions to install the tool manually

### Requirement: README design documentation SHALL describe implemented review execution

The README Design section SHALL reflect the current implemented capabilities: inventory/plan/report diagnostics, durable review sessions, command adapter execution, finding tracking, and finalization.

#### Scenario: README design section is current

**Given**: a reader opens the README Design section
**When**: they read the closing design description
**Then**: it does not claim that the project only creates inventory, plans, and matrices
**And**: it acknowledges the implemented session lifecycle and external command adapter support
