## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Review rules and prompts SHALL port the pinned OCR corpus

The default review logic SHALL derive its bundled prompts, path-based rules, and line-level review comment contract from Alibaba `open-code-review` commit `c323c6b40c72aa95d7cb801bedcb957b52ff9807`. The ported corpus SHALL include OCR's system rule map and all built-in rule documents, SHALL be usable without network access, and SHALL be included in the ruleset digest for stale-coverage detection. Review execution adapters SHALL use this OCR-derived prompt and verdict contract when asking external tools to review cells.

Generated review prompts SHALL identify the target file by repository root, repository-relative file path, content digest, file size in bytes, and line count. Generated prompts SHALL NOT embed the target file body directly. External review tools that need source content SHALL read the target file from the repository path identified in the prompt.

#### Scenario: OCR rule corpus is bundled and traceable

**Given**: the installed `review-gauntlet` package
**When**: the review ruleset is loaded
**Then**: the ruleset records upstream repository `https://github.com/alibaba/open-code-review`
**And**: records upstream commit `c323c6b40c72aa95d7cb801bedcb957b52ff9807`
**And**: exposes the default OCR rule map and all OCR rule documents as local package data

#### Scenario: OCR path rule mapping is preserved

**Given**: files named `pom.xml`, `package.json`, `Cargo.toml`, `src/app.ts`, `src/main.rs`, `src/main.c`, and `README.md`
**When**: the default ruleset selects review rules for those paths
**Then**: the selected rule documents match OCR's pinned system rule map
**And**: unmatched paths use OCR's `default.md` rule document

#### Scenario: OCR comments normalize into findings

**Given**: a review adapter returns OCR-style comments with `path`, `content`, `suggestion_code`, `existing_code`, `start_line`, `end_line`, and optional `thinking`
**When**: `review-gauntlet review` records the run
**Then**: each comment is normalized into a session finding occurrence
**And**: comments whose `start_line` and `end_line` are both `0` are preserved as imprecisely positioned findings rather than discarded

#### Scenario: OCR autonomous fix behavior is not adopted

**Given**: OCR plugin guidance can ask an agent to apply fixes after review
**When**: `review-gauntlet review` processes OCR-derived review output
**Then**: the CLI records findings and occurrences only
**And**: it does not modify source files or mark findings fixed automatically

#### Scenario: External command receives OCR-derived review prompt

**Given**: a selected review cell with a file path, content digest, byte size, line count, and rule id
**And**: the session is configured to use an external command adapter
**When**: `review-gauntlet review` invokes the adapter
**Then**: the generated prompt includes the selected OCR-derived rule guidance
**And**: the prompt identifies the file and review cell being evaluated
**And**: the prompt includes the target file path, content digest, byte size, and line count
**And**: the prompt does not embed the target file body
**And**: the prompt instructs the external command to read the target file from the repository path when content is needed
**And**: the prompt instructs the external command to return the OCR-style verdict JSON contract

### Requirement: Command adapter SHALL invoke external tools safely and preserve artifacts

The command adapter SHALL invoke configured tools without a shell, SHALL expose generated prompts through `{prompt}` argv/env template expansion, SHALL collect verdicts from stdout JSON when explicitly configured or from file JSON by default, and SHALL preserve per-cell artifacts for auditability. In file-json mode, stdout and stderr SHALL be preserved as logs but SHALL NOT be parsed or trusted as verdict input. The generated prompt exposed through `{prompt}` SHALL describe the target file with metadata rather than embedding the target file body.

#### Scenario: Command adapter executes without shell

**Given**: a valid command adapter configuration with `command` and `args` as structured values
**When**: `review-gauntlet review` invokes the command adapter
**Then**: the process is executed without `shell=True`
**And**: configured arguments are passed as an argv array
**And**: shell metacharacters in paths, arguments, or generated prompt text are not interpreted by a shell

#### Scenario: Command adapter expands generated prompt as argv element

**Given**: a command adapter configuration whose args include `{prompt}`
**When**: a review cell is evaluated
**Then**: `review-gauntlet` expands `{prompt}` to the generated OCR-derived prompt as one argv element
**And**: the expanded prompt identifies the target file using path, digest, byte size, and line count rather than file body text
**And**: the command adapter does not send the prompt through stdin as a transport side effect
**And**: the command adapter does not pass a prompt file as a transport side effect

#### Scenario: Command adapter supports stdout-json output

**Given**: a command adapter configuration explicitly using output mode `stdout-json`
**When**: a review cell is evaluated
**Then**: `review-gauntlet` validates the JSON verdict emitted to stdout
**And**: non-JSON stdout text remains invalid verdict output
