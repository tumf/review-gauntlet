## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Finalize SHALL validate completion without running review work

`status` and `finalize` SHALL tolerate malformed persisted finding-event metadata without crashing. Malformed terminal-decision metadata SHALL be surfaced conservatively as a blocker so completion cannot hide invalid waiver or accepted-risk state.

`review-gauntlet finalize` SHALL close a complete active review session into deterministic latest-only checkpoint files that are suitable for Git diff review and safe as the next review base. Finalization SHALL only write checkpoint files when completion blockers are absent, when review-universe files are clean relative to `HEAD`, and when current `HEAD` can be resolved to a commit. The checkpoint SHALL be derived from the existing durable session ledger, SHALL include review coverage, findings, triage events, and review-base metadata, and SHALL NOT replace the ledger as the source of truth before successful finalization.

Dirty review-universe blockers SHALL identify that review-universe files are dirty relative to `HEAD` without including individual dirty file paths in `finalize_blockers`.

#### Scenario: Dirty review-universe files block finalize

**Given**: an active review session that otherwise satisfies completion requirements
**And**: an eligible review-universe file has staged, unstaged, deleted, renamed, or untracked changes relative to `HEAD`
**When**: the developer runs `review-gauntlet finalize --format json`
**Then**: the command fails with a structured dirty-worktree blocker
**And**: the dirty-worktree blocker does not include the dirty file path
**And**: no latest checkpoint file is created or overwritten
**And**: the active session marker remains usable for continuing review work
**And**: no runtime session cleanup or archive is performed

#### Scenario: Dirty review-universe status omits dirty file paths

**Given**: an active review session that otherwise satisfies completion requirements
**And**: an eligible review-universe file has staged, unstaged, deleted, renamed, or untracked changes relative to `HEAD`
**When**: the developer runs `review-gauntlet status --format json`
**Then**: the result includes a structured dirty-worktree blocker in `finalize_blockers`
**And**: the dirty-worktree blocker does not include the dirty file path
